## Resubmission

* DESCRIPTION changed

* slw_on_selection is no longer an exported function. Instead a 
	variable to store the apps state is exported (.slw).

* an HTML filed created in the example is now saved to tempdir(),
	sleepwalk function doesn't save any files by default.

* We've just submitted the related paper, and therefore no reference can be provided at the
	moment.

>> Please provide executable examples in slw_on_selection.Rd and unwrap /donttest in slw_snapshot.Rd
Unfortunately, slw_snapshot requires an esteblished WebSocket connection with an opened web page, 
which is impossible during the automated testing. If there is no currently running Sleepwalk page,
the function will wait for 10 seconds and produce an error "Failed to get embedding data from the server".
